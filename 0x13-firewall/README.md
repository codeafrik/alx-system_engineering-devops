# Firewall

In this project, I used `ufw` to configure firewalls on my issued web servers.

## Useful recap notes about firewall
:
  * What is a firewall?
      - A hardware or software security system.
   * What are the 2 types of firewall?
       -Network and host-based firewall.
   * What is the main function of a firewall?
	-To filter incoming and outgoing network traffic.

## Tasks

* **0. Block all incoming traffic but**
  * [0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](./1-block_all_incoming_traffic_but): Bash
  script that installs a `ufw` firewall to block all incoming traffic except for
  ports `22`, `443` and `80` on a web server.

* **1. Port forwarding**
  * [100-port_forwarding](./100-port_forwarding): `ufw` configuration file that
  configures a firewall to redirect port `8080/TCP` to port `80/TCP`.
